# Example environment variables for the frontend
# Set the backend WebSocket host (host:port) used for real-time updates.
# If unset, the frontend will use the current window.location.host.
# For local development when backend runs on port 8000:
VITE_WS_HOST=localhost:8000

# Base URL for REST API calls. Leave unset to use the same origin as the
# deployed frontend. When front/back are separated, point to the backend URL:
# VITE_API_BASE=http://backend.example.com:8000
